# Fourier_Function_Approximate
A Python script that uses the Mathematical description of the Fourier series of a given function to generate the relevant function. This script uses numpy methods to compute the constants associated with the given function's fourier series. 
These constants are fed into a 'funcs' method that multiplies and adds the relevant terms together according to the mathematical description of the fourier series of that function.
The fourier approximate and the actual function are plotted using matplotlib.
